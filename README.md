# NURC/SP 

The NURC Project that started in 1969 to study the cultured linguistic urban norm spoken in five Brazilian capitals, was responsible for compiling a large corpus for each capital. The digitized NURC/SP comprises 375 inquiries in 334 hours of recordings taken in Sao Paulo capital.

The purpose of this repository is to provide resources for NURC/SP analysis and research projects.

## Research

We evaluated the a Minimum Corpus (MC) with 21 inquiries of the NURC/SP in the [Bringing NURC/SP to Digital Life: the Role of Open-source Automatic Speech Recognition Model]([https://arxiv.org/](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07852)) paper. For further details, see the [cm_analysis](https://github.com/nilc-nlp/nurc-sp/tree/master/cm_analysis/) directory.

## NURC/SP Minimum Corpus (MC)

CORAA NURC-SP Minimal Corpus is a manually annotated corpus of Brazilian Portuguese spontaneous speech (São Paulo variety). The corpus is a subset of NURC (‘Cultured Linguistic Urban Norm’) project collection, one of the most influential in Brazilian Linguistics. The corpus was brought to digital life by TaRSiLa, a project aiming to build large multi-purpose datasets for speech processing (ASR, TTS, and Sentiment Analysis). It comprises 21 audio files and audio-aligned multilevel transcripts according to linguistically motivated intonation units.
